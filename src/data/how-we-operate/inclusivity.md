Mutual respect is super important to everyone in [Liar]. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to discriminatory behaviour, which includes but isn't limited to: racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, abuse, hatred, and toxicity. With that in mind, we also don't want to foster an environment where everyone feels like they are walking on glass when it comes to what they should and should not say. Please remember that everyone is human, and sometimes we slip up. In general, jokes should be in good taste and shouldn't require someone to have to know you personally to know how serious you are about your comments. You can always bring any concerns with a member up to an officer or leader, and are encouraged to work out your differences with your fellow members.
