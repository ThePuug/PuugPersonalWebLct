While many guilds operate with a core focus on a certain aspect of the game, or as a place to casually hang out and have a tag to wear, \[Liar\] takes a different approach. Our core focus is human interaction. We cover a wide variety of in-game activities, but what we really strive to be is a home away from home for gamers. We encourage our members to be more than just a group of people wearing the same guild tag, but rather to reach out to other members of the guild and become friends.

Membership in \[Liar\] means we see you as part of our guild, as if it were a living organism. The things that happen in this guild happen because of you. Events, pick up groups, and social gatherings are a fluid system and function only when members take a step forward to organize them. We encourage all members to use the discord as if it were the platform on which you played the game. Many of us keep it running at all times, even when we aren't playing.

You can use our #looking-for-group channel to help party up with other guildies when looking to do content (the tag @here will notify everyone who is online currently, or @member if you want to give a shoutout to try and organize something in the future). Or, you can hop into one of our active voice channels to see what everyone else is up to. Many of us like to play a variety of games together, and to take the \[Liar\] community beyond the constraints of Guild Wars 2.

That being said, we understand that many people are shy or slow to open up, so please don't feel pressured to jump right into things at full swing. However know that the guild will be as great a place as you help make it!
