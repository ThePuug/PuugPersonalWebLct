## MISSION STATEMENT

[Liar] seeks to create an open, social environment where people can play together and enjoy anything cooperative gaming has to offer, especially in Guild Wars 2. We seek active, genial people interested in meeting and playing with others rather than recruiting based on experience or hours played. We recruit from all stages of gaming experience including people playing through the game for the first time to those seeking advanced content. Whether you are new to the game, a gaming veteran, or returning from a break, you'll find a helpful guild at [Liar] dedicated to improving your social gaming experience

The guild is a diverse group who strives to be inclusive of women, LGBT people, people with disabilities and people of all ethnic and religious backgrounds.

W‚Äçe welcome players from across the world, however please make sure you are on a North American server to play with us. Because we're a pretty rad group.
